/**
 * \brief A small fixed piece of the map, optimized for collisions and drawing.
 *
 * A tile is composed of a tile pattern that can be repeated.
 * Its pattern may be animated. It can be an obstacle or not.
 *
 * Tiles are optimized to allow fast detection of obstacles and
 * fast rendering of the non-animated ones.
 * The cost of these optimizations is that their presence on the map, their
 * position, their size and their obstacle property are fixed.
 * Tiles are added when the map is loaded and they are removed when the map
 * is destroyed.
 *
 * If you need to dynamically enable or disable a tile, see DynamicTile.
